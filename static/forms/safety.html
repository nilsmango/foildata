            <p>Downwind foiling (with a parawing or SUP foil) is incredibly rewarding, but it can also be dangerous. Especially for beginners, wind strength, changing conditions, and proper planning play a crucial role. With good preparation, the right equipment, and respect for the conditions, downwind runs can remain controlled, safe, and enjoyable.</p>
        
            <p>This guide focuses on <strong>practical safety rules for downwind foiling</strong>, including preparation, self-rescue, and emergency situations.</p>
        
            <h2>Preparation (MUST-DO CHECKLIST)</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>If possible, <strong>do not go downwind foiling alone</strong> → find & add you local spots and crew in our <a href="/foildata/map">foiling map</a></li>
                <li>Use a <strong>board leash</strong> and inspect it before every run</li>
                <li>Take a <strong>phone</strong> with you (waterproofed) and <strong>share your live location</strong> with someone</li>
                <li>Tell someone your <strong>plan</strong> (route, expected exit point, and timing)</li>
                <li>Wear the <strong>correct neoprene suit</strong> for the water temperature</li>
                <li>In cold conditions: pack <strong>closed neoprene gloves</strong> in case you need to paddle back by hand</li>
                <li>In hot conditions: use <strong>sun protection</strong></li>
                <li>Wear a <strong>personal flotation device (PFD)</strong> with a <strong>whistle and light</strong></li>
                <li>Bring <strong>food (fast energy)</strong> and <strong>drinking water</strong></li>
                <li>Carry a <strong>tourniquet</strong> for deep foil cuts</li>
                <li>Extra safety: bring a <strong>personal locator beacon (PLB)</strong> with a strobe light</li>
                <li>Extra safety: wear a <strong>helmet</strong></li>
                <li>Extra safety: wear something <strong>brightly colored</strong></li>
                <li>Check the <strong>weather forecast</strong> (temperature, swell, wind, lightning) and <strong>daylight hours</strong></li>
                <li>Prefer <strong>short, safe runs</strong> over one long and committing run, especially in winter or strong winds</li>
                <li>Bonus tip for the ocean: bring a line cutter knife</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>Have a Plan B (Self-Rescue)</h2>
        
            <p>Your paddle can break. Your parawing, foil, or even your board can be lost. Always assume that <strong>something may fail</strong>.</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Stay within <strong>realistic paddling distance</strong> of shore (for most this is less than 2 km)</li>
                <li>Keep enough <strong>energy reserve</strong> for self-rescue</li>
                <li>If everything fails, you must be able to <strong>swim or paddle back to shore</strong></li>
                <li>After a fall, take time to recover: <strong>stay calm, breathe, reset</strong></li>
                <li>Do not rush back onto foil when tired or stressed</li>
                <li>When in doubt, <strong>abort early</strong></li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>In Case of Emergency</h2>
        
            <p>If all preparation fails:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay with your board</strong> whenever possible</li>
                <li>Call <strong>112</strong> (works in most countries worldwide) or <strong>911</strong> (US, Canada, Mexico) and have your coordinates ready.</li>
                <li>Use your <strong>whistle, light, or strobe</strong></li>
                <li>Wave <strong>both arms above your head</strong> to signal for help</li>
                <li>Use your PLB if everything else fails.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Moronic Downwind Foiling Safety Tips</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Leashes are for dogs, don’t let anybody think you are a kook by using one</li>
                <li>Traveling light is essential: no vest, phone, water, food, board shorts only</li>
                <li>Under no circumstances go foiling in conditions you are familiar with or comfortable in</li>
                <li>Never tell anybody what downwind run you have planned</li>
                <li>Sand your mast and foils as sharp as possible</li>
                <li>Nighttime runs are the best time of day</li>
                <li>No need for conditioning, don’t train your fitness, it’s for influencers</li>
                <li>Even if you’ve never foiled before, just go out there. You’ll figure it out on the fly</li>
                <li>New gear? Best place to test it is a sketchy 100 km run</li>
                <li>Historically, the best carvers have always been ninjas. Dress accordingly, dark colours are key (this is where your common sense is required: will you dress like a ninja to not be seen, but then have the problem of too much sun protection or not travelling light enough?)</li>
                <li>If in doubt, continue. Don’t be a little bitch, always go all in</li>
                <li>Success does not come for free: always go well beyond your limits</li>
                <li>Having a plan B means you are not fully committed to plan A</li>
                <li>If in trouble, freak out and fight for your life, there’s no help coming</li>
                <li>The further away from shore, the more fun</li>
                <li>Hurricanes or lightning storms make the best waves</li>
                <li>Every man for himself: you fall, you die</li>
            </ul>
