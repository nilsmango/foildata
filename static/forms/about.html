        foildata is a growing collection of tools and data for the foiling community. 
        We focus on a foiling map of the world, with downwind foiling runs, wing foil spots, parawing spots, wake thief spots, and useful resources for foilers and other water sports.
        </p>
        <p>
        The goal of foildata is to build a comprehensive, community-driven database of 
        foils, boards, parawings, foiling spots, and downwind routes worldwide — paired 
        with reviews, videos, and practical information.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to spot data, foildata will feature large comparison tables for 
        foils, boards, and parawings, including sorting and filtering tools to help 
        foilers choose the right gear.
